In this JavaScript Project source code series I was created a simple Pacman Game 
Project console game. 

This Pacman Game has a resemblance with the snake game. 
As the Pacman is driven to move along the predefined path. 

The white path is eaten or erased by the Pacman as it moves. 
You can score more if you eat more paths.

This is a game application that has realistic nature and is simple to play. 

Pacman Game Project is a c console-based application, designed using JavaSript and
HTML codes. 

Here, the user-defined header file creates the source code, 
the behavior and moving direction of the Pacman are controlled by JavaScript code. 

You can clone this game by git clone using this command git clone https://github.com/Jeremiah-Silva/Pacman.git 
or you can click on the website https://pacman-tau.vercel.app/Index.html to execute.
